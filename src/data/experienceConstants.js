        description: "I was part of the Alexa Video team at Amazon, where I focused on developing new features to expand the hints services internationally. My key contribution was creating an end-to-end working proof of concept (POC) that enabled multi-language hints, triggered by the payload of a RESTful API. I effectively transformed the project’s initial aim into a viable and executable plan by refactoring the hints architecture, which allowed multi-language hints to be displayed on universal search and home screens. Additionally, I designed the database schema in DynamoDB and implemented the business logic using Java design patterns. This POC significantly enhanced Alexa's hint services, extending them to over 50% of Amazon’s international market."

        description: "I developed the backend using Spring Boot, which included integrating various layers such as DAO/repository, Controller, Service, and Persistence. I managed database creation and Hibernate ORM connectivity, implemented Spring authentication, resolved CORS issues, and created unit tests with JUnit while using Postman for RESTful API service testing. On the frontend, I built a React application using stateful class components, Redux for state management, and React lifecycle methods to enhance user experience. I crafted reusable React components, leveraged props for component interaction, and ensured application security with React-Router and Axios for HTTP requests. Additionally, I maintained Git repositories, used JIRA for project tracking, and actively participated in the SDLC and Scrum meetings."
